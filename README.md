Generates a table calendar to put on your webpage. 
I looked at some other calendars that were simple, but the code was also required a lot of searching to customize the table, so I wrote one that's easier to deal with. See the example for what it looks like by default (assuming you have bootstrap).


Usage:

    <script type='text/javascript'>
        $(function() {
            $('#calendar').calendarize()
        })
    </script>
That's it.
